        <p>Hi, and welcome to my Year 11 website, which is being created to act as a 'portfolio'. Throughout this year, it will show 3 different projects that I will be creating, showing my proficiency in various skills in the tech industry, such as coding with Godot, modelling skills in programs such as blender, and also web-building languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These project pages will outline my design process, as I work through and complete my projects. Please refer to the navigation bar at the top in order to find and nagivate to pages detailing information about me, as well as ways to contact me if you are interested.
